# Implementation of Boyer-Moore

This repo mainly focused on reimplementing boyer-moore algorithm as instructed by FIT3155 lab task. 
Run time comparison between boyer moore, z algorithm and Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm is also implemented

 

### Prerequisites

i did not really make use of tqdm and numpy, you may delete import statement in the code

```
python >= 3
tqdm 
numpy
```

## example

```
python comptime.py
```

```
time for z algo: 00:01:26
time for kmp: 00:01:17
time for boyer moore: 00:02:22
```
